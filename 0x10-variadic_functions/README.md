0x10. C - Variadic functions

In programming, a function is a set of instructions that perform a specific task. For example
a function might add two numbers together or print a message on the screen.
Normally, when we create a function in C, we have to tell
it exactly how many arguments (or pieces of information) we want it to work with.

However, sometimes we want to create a function that can work with a variable number of arguments.
This is where a variadic function comes in! A variadic function
is a function that can accept a different number of arguments each time it is called.

PROJECT TASKS:
- task 0. a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
- task 1. a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
- task 2. a function that prints strings, followed by a new line.
- task 3. a function that prints anything.
