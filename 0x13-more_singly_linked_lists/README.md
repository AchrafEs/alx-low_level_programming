0x13-more_singly_linked_lists:

A singly linked list is a linear data structure in C that consists of a sequence of nodes.
Each node contains two fields: one to store data and another to point to the next node in the sequence.
The first node in the sequence is called the head node, while the last node points to NULL to indicate the end of the list.

Singly linked lists are useful for implementing dynamic data structures, such as stacks, queues, and hash tables,
as well as for general-purpose data storage and manipulation.
