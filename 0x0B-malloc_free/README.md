In this directory we'll be learning about:

* Malloc Function.
* free function.

Malloc : is a function that allows you to dynamically allocate memory for a variable during runtime. You tell the function how much memory you need, and it returns a pointer to the first byte of that memory block.
free   : is a function that releases the memory back to the operating system.
